## Business Understanding
- When a lending organization recieves a loan application, it has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile.
- Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
    1. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
    2. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the         company
- The data given below contains the information about past loan applicants (2007-2011) and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not.
